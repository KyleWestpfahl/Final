    <p class="lsup">Coach Ogeron talks, smells, looks, and coaches the same.</p>
    <p class="lsup">Troughout history LSU has had terrible coaches if it wasn't boring football with Les Miles</p>

    <h2 class="h2-football">Quarterbacks</h2>
    <p class="lsup">LSU has always had until this year quaterbacks that put up a averge of 5 and a half points a game</p>
    <p class="lsup">This year is a once in a century exception for LSU's offense and next year will come back down to reality again somehow scoring less than Iowa </p>
    <p class="lsup"> This is a picture of one of LSU's better quarterbacks in the last decade except he is a safety for Vanderbilt now smh...</p>
